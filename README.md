# iot_proj
The goal of the project is to create a contactless fan as a mid-term project for class IOT


# notes
Some file names and variables contain strong language due to pent-up frustration stored during the working period. Please proceed with cautions.

The project is done using 
- STM32 NUCLEOF411RE
- STM32Cubeide
- Ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04)
- Humidity and Temperature Sensor (DHT-11)
- Nodemcu Esp8266 for hosting a server.

As of current, the project can read value from ultrasonic sensor and display it to HUART and nothing else, lul.
Will update the rest later.
